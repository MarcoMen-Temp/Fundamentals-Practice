## Fundamentals For Data Analysis- Practical Assignments
### A Notebook By : Marco Men

## Issues Encountered

There were no major issues, there was no lack of documentation available on the dataset and different analysis. The only quirk was the notebook in which I found inspiration was written in R, but as I mentioned on my notebook : '... not an issue'.


## Lessons Learned

I found working with Pandas again an absolute pleasure. Together with statsmodels can make pose R some serious competition with regards to Data Science.
I first come in contact with statsmodels library package while reading 'Pandas For Everyone' - Daniel Y. Chen, where he uses it on his book to run correlation and covariance in model testing. Also, residuals and QQ plots are featured in his book.
At first I wanted to include a QQ plot, but then I decided against as I was satisfied with my residuals and linear regression ( fitted regerssion line ).
Of course in Chen's book, statsmodels is mentioned mildly. But for avid Data enthisiasts and curious people, this mild mention is enough to spark interest. So I have been reading from time to time statmodels.org ( documentation ) and trying some interesting plotting.
Statsmodels is a recent python package ( still a beta version, I believe ) but just like Pandas extremely useful in the area of statistics and Data Science. 
I am almost certain that Anscombe would have not mind having such tools available in his time.
